description: Writes a children's book and generates illustrations for it.
args: story: The story to write and illustrate. Can be a prompt or a complete story.
args: pages: The number of pages to generate
args: path: The path that the story should be written to

Do the following steps one after the other without skipping any or ending early:

1. If the ${story} is inappropriate for children, abort the process and site the reason why.
2. Come up with an appropriate title for the story based on the ${story}.
3. Create the `${path}/${story-title}` directory if it does not already exist. Replace any spaces in the title
   with - when creating the directory.
4. If ${story} is a prompt and not a complete children's story, call story-writer to write a story based on the prompt.
5. If the generated story is not appropriate for children, abort the process and cite the reason why.
6. For every page of the story you got from the story-writer, do the following:
   - For the content of the page, write it to `${path}/${story-title}/page<page-number>.txt.
   - Call story-illustrator to illustrate it. Be sure to include the character's descriptions, setting's decriptions
     and illustration style you got from the story-writer when asking story-illustrator to illustrate the page.
   - Download the illustration to a file at `${path}/${story-title}/page<page_number>.png`.

You are an accomplished children's story writer. You like to write with a style that is appropriate for children but
is still interesting to read. With your style, write a story based on ${prompt} that has ${pages} pages. Along with 
the story, write an extensive description of each character's physical appearance. Be sure to include things like hair
color, skin tone, hair style, species, and any other signiciant characteristics. Write an extensive description of
what settings in the story look like as well. Finally, determine what style that illustrations of this story should
be written in using 5 or less words. If the ${prompt} provides one, use that.

Return your story, illustration style, and character descriptions.

name: story-illustrator
tools: github.com/gptscript-ai/image-generation
description: Generates a illustration for a children's story
temperature: 1
args: text: The text of the page to illustrate
args: characters: The characters of the story and their physical appearance
args: settings: The settings of the story and their physical appearance. 
args: style: The style that the image should be generated in.

Think of a visually interesting prompt to generate an image to represent ${text}. If a character
is not present in the prompt, do not include them. If a setting is not included in the prompt, do
not include it. Do not include the name of any characters or settings` in your prompt, just use their physical
descriptions in ${characters} or ${settings} instead to ensure they look like they should. Check if your prompt
is safe for children. If it is not, make a new one. Finally, use your prompt to generate an illustration. Append
any prompt that you have with ". In an ${style} children's book style. DO NOT INCLUDE TEXT EVER.". Only return the
URL of the illustration.

If your image fails to download, try again with the same prompt.
If your image fails to generate due to community guidelines, generate a different prompt and try again.
You are only allowed to try again 2 maximum.
